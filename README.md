# AI PC Optimizer

AI PC Optimizer is a dynamic web application designed to monitor and optimize your computer's resource usage, including CPU, RAM, and storage. It provides real-time metrics, suggestions for improvements, and a simple music player to enhance your working experience.

## Project Overview

The application features:
- Real-time system metrics for CPU, RAM, storage, and temperature.
- Interactive charts to visualize system performance over time.
- Recommendations based on current resource usage to aid in optimization.
- A built-in music player for a better working environment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-pc-optimizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-pc-optimizer
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the application:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

4. Make sure you have an internet connection to load external libraries like Tailwind CSS and Font Awesome.

## Usage

Once the application is open in your browser, the dashboard will display the current system metrics. Here’s how to interact with the application:

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** The application updates system metrics every second and displays them on the dashboard.
- **Optimization Recommendations:** Suggestions will be generated based on current usage. For example, if CPU usage is too high, the app will recommend closing unnecessary programs.
- **Music Player:** You can play, pause, and control the volume of background music while using the application.

## Features

- **CPU Usage Monitoring:** Displays current CPU usage percentage, core count, and speed.
- **RAM Usage Monitoring:** Displays current RAM usage and total memory available.
- **Storage Monitoring:** Shows storage usage percentage and the amount of available space.
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Monitors CPU temperature in real-time.
- **Visual Charts:** Interactive charts visualize CPU, RAM, storage usage, and temperature over time.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes for accessibility.
- **Settings:** Customize themes, toggle alerts for system metrics, and set optimization thresholds.
- **AI Recommendations:** Provides suggestions based on current system performance for better optimization.
